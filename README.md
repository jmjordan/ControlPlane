ControlPlane
============

What is ControlPlane
--------------------

ControlPlane, a fork of MarcoPolo, brings context and location sensitive awareness to OS X.  With ControlPlane you can intelligently reconfigure your Mac or perform any number of actions based on input from a wide variety of evidence sources including but not limited to available WiFi networks, current location, connected monitors, connected and nearby bluetooth devices, currently running apps and other configurable sources.  You will find a full feature list at <http://www.controlplaneapp.com/feature-list>.

How ControlPlane Works
----------------------

Using fuzzy logic, ControlPlane decides where you are and/or what you are doing (called a Context) using rules that you configure to then carry out any number of configured actions.

An example of how to use ControlPlane may include disabling the screensaver password while at work but enabling it when away from work.  Another example would be to set your Adium status.
